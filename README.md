## Recommended Mods:

Better Combat by daedelus:
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-combat-by-daedelus

Better Combat reqs Cloth Config and Player animator, linked here:
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/playeranimator

Also requires Loot Integrations https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/loot-integrations
to naturally spawn weapons in loot chests, compatible with vanilla and Yung's Dungeons/Strongholds.
_Make sure you install the fabric version!_

 if you want to add more mod compatibility then do it youself with a datapack its not that hard... well it is but whatever


## Description:

This is my (Nyo's) first mod, created mostly from looking at other mods and using the fabric wiki https://fabricmc.net/wiki

It may have a few problems buttttttttt should be fine ;)
The mod was designed for a private modded server.
Don't expect any updates or anything though, its quite unlikely but if there is demand i might try figure out how to update the mod


## Requirements:

Fabric loader and Fabric API for 1.19.2 is 100% required.

If you want it to be playable in survival you'll need Loot Integrations (linked above), i'd add it either way. 
Loot Integrations only needs to be installed server side.

I HIGHLY RECCOMEND that you install Better Combat (linked above) as this
mod sucks without it and I designed it to work with Better Combat anyway.

_Weapons scale fine with BackSlot mod, but they can be worn on the belt, even the big weapons so it looks a bit weird, I can't resolve the problem atm though 
so if someone knows how to help fix it since ik its because backslot uses all sword items_

oh and you should prob own a copy of minecraft java too :|


## Credit:

Fabric, and Minecraft for existing

Creator of Loot Integrations for saving my sanity <3

Textures are from Songs Of War by Black Plasma Studios, credit to them for 90% of this pack's items

Some weapons are from Terraria by ReLogic, by a friend's behest

And the remaining textures are found on NovaSkin, a minecraft texture site. On there stuff gets passed around a lot
so some of the textures including the Crucible and Lightsaber have no obvious origin or creator, 

although if the real creator wants me to remove anything they own **please let me know**
