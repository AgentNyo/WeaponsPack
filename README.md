# Nyo's Weapons Pack

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
**A fabric mod for Minecraft containing over 50 unique weapons designed to work with the Better Combat mod**

Best with the Better Combat and Loot Integrations mods!
## Fabric only!


Includes the Deathsinger's Sword and Tidesinger's Staff from Songs Of War among other weapons from the series too, and also a craftable quarter of a diamond which can be used as currency!

I didn't make the animations (They're from Better Combat) and nor did i make the textures and the weapons, I just made the mod for them to be usable.
This mod was inspired by older Songs Of War mods that haven't been updated for a while, most of which still being forge ~1.12.2

### Recommended Mods:

For the epic animations -
Better Combat by daedelus: https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat

Better Combat requires Cloth Config and Player animator, linked here -
https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config
https://modrinth.com/mod/playeranimator

For colored enchantments (like in songs of war) -
Enchant the Rainbow: (very good mod) https://modrinth.com/mod/enchant-the-rainbow 

For making the weapons spawn in survival loot chests -
Loot Integrations https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/loot-integrations  
(could not find a modrinth version, but there may be alternatives out there)

Compatible with vanilla chests and Yung's Better Dungeons/Strongholds, you can add compatibility with other mod loot yourself using datapacks!

#### !Make sure you install the fabric versions!

 


 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Description:

This is my (Nyo's) first mod, created mostly from looking at other mods and using the fabric wiki https://fabricmc.net/wiki

 

It may have a few problems buttttttttt should be fine ;) The mod was designed for a private modded server, so don't expect any updates or anything

i am slowly considering coming back to mod development so there may be updates/new mods in the future



 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Requirements:

Fabric loader and Fabric API for 1.19.2 is 100% required.

 

If you want it to be playable in survival you'll need Loot Integrations __(linked above)__, i'd add it either way. Loot Integrations only needs to be installed server side.

 

**I HIGHLY RECCOMEND** that you install Better Combat __(linked above)__ as this mod sucks without it and I designed it to work with Better Combat anyway

Weapons scale fine with BackSlot mod, but they can be worn on the belt, even the big weapons so it looks a bit weird, I can't resolve the problem atm though so if someone knows how to, fix it, since its because backslot uses all sword items as wearable on belt

### Credit:

Fabric, and Minecraft for existing

Creator of Loot Integrations for saving my sanity <3

Weapon textures are not mine, I just programmed them into a mod

Textures are from Songs Of War by Black Plasma Studios, credit to them for 90% of this pack's items

Some weapons are from Terraria by ReLogic, at a friend's behest

And the remaining textures are found on NovaSkin, a minecraft texture site. On there stuff gets passed around a lot so some of the textures including the Crucible and Lightsaber have no obvious origin or creator,

although if the real creator wants me to remove anything they own please let me know
